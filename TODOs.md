## TODO

<!-- 
- making it responsive
 -->

### 1 - downloadable canvas
 <!-- to the point where the user enters any text -->
- then he choses the colors
- then a jpg img gets created

## 2 - choose the 2nd color | choose themes
- I think letting the user choose their own theme colors would be better

## 3 - 4 simple small steps
**dynamicly-generated** :
1) background colors _done_ [0x89e673, 0x000fa0]
2) text in bottom on each edge _done_
3) uploaded image above them
4) Name (fff bg) && (z-index: 1) on the image

## more on
- custom font colors
- some restrictions (validation)
